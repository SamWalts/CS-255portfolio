    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    DriverPass was a client that wanted a cloud based system in order to facilitate client online courses, as well as scheduling driving lessons.
    What did you do particularly well?
    I think that my diagrams were well done, and would be very helpful to anyone who was looking at them to create the system.
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    The Business Requirements document. I think that I should have gone into more detail on the security side, however there wasn't much requirements other than make it secure.
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The clients included a 3 person team consisting of the owner, the IT department, and a secretary. Most of the functionality was the same, they would just get Admin access, or elevated access. Designing the system this way keeps us from having to create 2 completely different systems.
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    Working on the design document and the flow charts is an amazing time saver. Having the users listed, helps keep everything organized, and I will definitaly continue the practice.
